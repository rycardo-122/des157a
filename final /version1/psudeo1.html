            <p class=>I love to adventure out and find new places to visit that are local to me. Last month when visiting Sacramento I found myself in this midcentury/ modern furniture store called Scout Living. I found myself wondering through this space for more than an hour due to how well their selection of pieces was curated. I love furniture and interior design and I think that I was inspired by this space and the way that it was set up.</p>

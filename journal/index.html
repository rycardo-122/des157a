            When it comes to design/ UX/UI design it is important to remember that minimizing the amount of questions prompted to gain information from the user allows for a faster turnaround. Having too much information can overload the user and drive them away from filling vital information. Organization is one of the most important aspects of user experience design. Without a formal structure the layout will look messy and confusing. One way to avoid this is by guide-lining the web page design by using columns. A popular format is to use 1-3 columns to divide the text, images, and information. For forms or mobile layout the use of a 1 column grid allows the user to move throughout the information at a more effective rate. Focusing on highlighting the important questions beforehand also helps with avoiding missing information. Making the important questions mandatory directs the user to completing necessary portions of digital forms without compromising their attention span.

            While some information may seem self explanatory one has to remember that not all users navigate through technology and the web at the same levels. Labeling information can be one of the most important aspects of UX/UI design. Having labels guides users to the right portions of the page and directs them to complete the action correctly. Placeholder text also works in a similar way. Rather than being used to fill up the information so that the user doesnâ€™t have to. Placeholder text can be used as a form of directions showcasing an example of what the user should fill in there.

            Accessibility will always be one of the most important focuses that designers should keep in mind. The use of color schemes that work together aesthetically is not enough. Designers need to check if the color values work together and are visible for users with a hard time seeing color. Sizing of the text also has to be large enough to be readable by all. And lastly creating a responsive webpage encourages the use of the site throughout all types of devices, allowing all types of users to navigate through the site despite the device they are using.

            One of  the best examples of a site that exemplifies the best practices in design is the Spotify website. The spotify website and the mobile application have been out for several years now, with hundreds of development and UI iterations I believe that they finally found a solid system that works for them. The typefaces and colors that they use work well aesthetically; they are also following accessibility guidelines that are implemented subtly throughout the app/ site. The use of buttons and simplified directions allows the user to figure out the system that spotify wants to create with its website. Lastly I believe that they have designers that have paid attention to users and their habits. Learning how to better a site from user research and creating a new way to navigate through a site in a more efficient way is rare, however I believe that Spotify is doing it right so far.

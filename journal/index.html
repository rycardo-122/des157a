            When thinking of prompts for this project the idea of touching on my instrument collection throughout my room came to mind. I figured since music is such an important part of my life that I might as well show it through a tour of my room and showcase images that accompany the instruments to tell a deeper story to these objects. The image I chose here is one of me playing at The Smell in downtown LA with Dean Decay. Dean Decay is a post punk band that I play in when I visit in SoCal. I play the synthesizer for this band, the one I own is called a Korg Monolouge. A synth looks very similar to a keyboard or piano however the sound that comes out of it is much more unique. With synthesizers one can create different patches that modulate more electronic sounds, similar to the sounds you hear in 80’s and 90’s music.

            This image relates to my collection because it touches on my passion for music. I have been playing and making music since early high-school. Throughout the years I have collected different types of instruments and hardware for recording and playing. My love for music is very broad and has allowed me to appreciate all forms of music. The instruments I have all help me produce different timbres and sounds to expand my knowledge of different genres.

            Although art and design are two of my biggest inspirations and passions I sometimes need a mental break to recharge and not get burnt out of these creative fields. Music for me is an escape for many reasons. Personally I believe that music is one of the most versatile forms of art that can be enjoyed, shared, and experienced more intensely than anything else. When I am done for the day with my school and work tasks and want to spend some time alone I instantly turn to making music. For me music is a way to express how I feel and it helps me learn much more about myself. As of lately I have been trying to focus on taking music more seriously and have finally started to record, mix, and master a few songs that I have slowly been putting out on music platforms. Another reason I love music is the connections and friendships that I have made throughout the years through it. I have met some of my closest friends because of music. During covid I spent a-lot of time on discord and reddit where I met lots of producers and musicians online. Since then I’ve met up with a few of them and played music with them. I believe that creating music with friends is one of the most rewarding things that comes out of connecting with other creative people.

            From the looks of it  Rheina is at the Palace of the fine arts in San Francisco. The outfit she is wearing looks very coordinated and bright. Maybe she was there for an event or special gathering. I also believe that Rheina could have gone to the Palace of the Fine Arts to visit and look at the architecture. I visited the same location a couple of weeks ago and was surprised at how grand the architecture of the building is. My last guess is that Rheina is into fashion and wanted to take a candid picture including her outfit with an interesting background. 
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that the visual elements in this image do a good job at capturing the viewer's attention. The colors within this image all work very well together, the yellow boots and the purple/ lavender suit that she is wearing compliments each other really well. The focus of the image is mainly on Rheina’s outfit, however she does a great job at showcasing the setting that she is in. It also looks like the image has been edited to show high contrast or saturation in the color. 
           </p>
           <p>
            The most obvious aspect of this image is the location of the image. I think that the Palace of the Fine Arts is a very popular location within San Francisco. Although the location is one of the more obvious aspects of the image I am having a hard time figuring out the occasion and if the outfit was planned for a certain event.

            Learning how to analyze and interpret photography can boost one's understanding of what they are viewing and help them in collecting more takeaways from these still images. Looking closely is an important factor that one has to take into consideration. Obviously the term “look closely” can go over some peoples heads, however paying close attention to the details in images helps them gain a better understanding of the image as a whole. Allowing yourself to build on other observations is also a learned skill that supports the viewer in gaining knowledge from other perspectives. Personally this is why I enjoy to go to museums with friends. Getting to hear their opinions and perspectives on how they feel about the images we see together helps me realize new ideas and takeaways that I would not have come to on my own. With the ability to listen to others comes the conversation that starts after. Conversing about art or photography is just as important as the subject that is being viewed. Allowing others to convey their thoughts, opinions, and even arguments opens the floor for discussion on the images. With this discussion one can choose to take away new ways of viewing the photography and analyzing it.

                Keeping these practices in mind was my goal when analyzing Nick Dap’s portfolio/website. Nick dap is a graphic designer as well as an art creative who merges photography and graphic design to create a unique way of creating art. The images shown in his webpage look like they are older, almost as if they were shot on film. I believe that he uses a-lot of textures and overlays through photoshop and illustrator to create the look that he gets. He also focuses on collaging several images and components of design to create distorted looking figure. I find his work inspiring because the images might look very simple from afar, however the attention to detail within his works is noticeable. I enjoy art and photos that nudge the viewer to look deeper into the work of art.

            Modals, overlays, and dialog windows serve an important purpose in the world of User Interface design. These are elements that overlay over an application's main window. Although they take the main center of the screen the background information can still be slightly visible to let the user know that they haven’t left the current window. Getting the users information is one of the main purposes for modal windows. For many sites that involve important information having a modal window helps emphasize the information in the modal before the user can move forward through the site. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally I do not mind modal windows unless they resemble advertisement modals. When it comes to advertisement modal windows the exit function is usually hidden or minimized so that the user ends up clicking on the advertisement link rather than quickly opting out. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most common modal windows that I have noticed nowadays are the modal windows embedded within social media sites. Twitter has a great usage of the modal overlay. The main action for twitter is to tweet, rather than directing you to a separate portion of the site twitter allows the user to feel as if they are still in their feed while tweeting. Same goes for applications like Gmail, discord, and slack.

            When it comes to design/ UX/UI design it is important to remember that minimizing the amount of questions prompted to gain information from the user allows for a faster turnaround. Having too much information can overload the user and drive them away from filling vital information. Organization is one of the most important aspects of user experience design. Without a formal structure the layout will look messy and confusing. One way to avoid this is by guide-lining the web page design by using columns. A popular format is to use 1-3 columns to divide the text, images, and information. For forms or mobile layout the use of a 1 column grid allows the user to move throughout the information at a more effective rate. Focusing on highlighting the important questions beforehand also helps with avoiding missing information. Making the important questions mandatory directs the user to completing necessary portions of digital forms without compromising their attention span. 
        </p>

        <p>
            While some information may seem self explanatory one has to remember that not all users navigate through technology and the web at the same levels. Labeling information can be one of the most important aspects of UX/UI design. Having labels guides users to the right portions of the page and directs them to complete the action correctly. Placeholder text also works in a similar way. Rather than being used to fill up the information so that the user doesn’t have to. Placeholder text can be used as a form of directions showcasing an example of what the user should fill in there.    
        </p>

        <p>
            Accessibility will always be one of the most important focuses that designers should keep in mind. The use of color schemes that work together aesthetically is not enough. Designers need to check if the color values work together and are visible for users with a hard time seeing color. Sizing of the text also has to be large enough to be readable by all. And lastly creating a responsive webpage encourages the use of the site throughout all types of devices, allowing all types of users to navigate through the site despite the device they are using. 
        </p>

        <p>
            One of  the best examples of a site that exemplifies the best practices in design is the Spotify website. The spotify website and the mobile application have been out for several years now, with hundreds of development and UI iterations I believe that they finally found a solid system that works for them. The typefaces and colors that they use work well aesthetically; they are also following accessibility guidelines that are implemented subtly throughout the app/ site. The use of buttons and simplified directions allows the user to figure out the system that spotify wants to create with its website. Lastly I believe that they have designers that have paid attention to users and their habits. Learning how to better a site from user research and creating a new way to navigate through a site in a more efficient way is rare, however I believe that Spotify is doing it right so far.

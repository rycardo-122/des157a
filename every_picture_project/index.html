                <p>I love to adventure out and find new places to visit that are local to me. Last month when visiting Sacramento I found myself in this midcentury/ modern furniture store called Scout Living. I found myself wondering through this space for more than an hour due to how well their selection of pieces was curated. I love furniture and interior design and I think that I was inspired by this space and the way that it was set up.</p>

                <p>For me my room is my safe space. After having a long day of work or school it is always reading to be able to feel comfortable in my own space without having any stress. I spend a-lot of time reading, writing, and making music in my room. I believe that I get inspired to be creative in this space because it belongs to me and I was able to decorate it and make it feel cozy.

                <p>Recently I was able to finally swap out my vehicle that I had for about five years to a hybrid car. I loved my car, however the amount of times that it crashed on me or had technical problems started to become too much for me. Thankfully I was able to sell it about two weeks ago and got a hybrid car that is much better for the environment and my wallet!</p>

                <p>During the summer of last year I was lucky enough to get an internship at Snapchat. Because the covid regulations were finally easing off I was able to work at the company campus in Venice, California. Originally I lived at my parents home in Santa Clarita which is about an hour and a half commute to the Snapchat offices. I didnâ€™t know if that commute would be realistic 5 times a week so I searched for housing in L.A. and was able to find some with my friend Jaylen. He offered me a stay at his house in Culver city which made the commute much shorter! Every-time I visit his house I am reminded of the great times I had there and how welcoming his door mat is.</p>

                <p>I am a big fan of the brand Arcteryx and found out that they were having an event in the bay last winter. I gathered my hosuemates and convinced them to come with me and join me at this event. To our surprise the event was mainly focused on climbing and even had musical performers like Portugal the Man. My hosuemates and I had no climbing experience prior to this event, however ever since we have been inspired to start climbing for fun.</p>

    <h1>Hello Bob!</h1>

    <h2>Here is your cheese</h2>

    //I used Cory Risch-Smith's prompt as inspiration for my  Experimentation! I am still getting the hang of using prompt() within my code however I was able to write a simple function that asks for the users name. After asking for their name it asks them if they would like some cheese. Just like Cory did instead of implementing the written answers within the console I moved them to h1 and h2 tags to show on the browser once the text boxes are filled in!

var yourName = prompt('provide your name',"");
var food = ['cheese'];
function hello(name, Cheese){
    console.log(hello(name) );
}


var yourName = prompt('would you like some Cheese?',"");
var food = ['cheese'];
function hello(Bob){

}
